# stocks-analysis

Overview of Project
We were tasked to analyze the performance of green energy stocks.  We want to decide if we should diversify our portfolio of stocks or if we should continue being all in on the DAQO New Energy Corp. In addition to analyzing green energy stocks we wanted to ensure that our solution was reusable and allows analysis of other stocks.
