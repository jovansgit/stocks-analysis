# stocks-analysis

## Overview of Project

We were tasked to analyze the performance of green energy stocks.  We want to decide if we should diversify our portfolio of stocks or if we should continue being all in on the DAQO New Energy Corp. In addition to analyzing green energy stocks we wanted to ensure that our solution was reusable and allows analysis of other stocks.

## Results

Before refactoring when running our code for the year 2017 our macro ran in 0.3203125 and after refactoring our code ran in 0.078125

## Benefits of refactioring code
Refactoring code can improve the eficiency and readability of our code.  We can create reduce duplicate code which can make it easier when testing or finding bugs.  Refactoring can also make our code easier to read for other developers.
## Cons of refactoring code
There can be disadvantages when refactoring code as well.  Refactoring can introduce new bugs to our existing code and it can be time consuming without providing users new functionality.
